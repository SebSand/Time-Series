# Time-Series

This project analyzes MercadoLibre's financial and user data to see if the ability to predict search traffic can translate into the ability to trade the stock.

It is divided in 4 steps: 

* Step 1: Find unusual patterns in hourly Google search traffic

* Step 2: Mine the search traffic data for seasonality

* Step 3: Relate the search traffic to stock price patterns

* Step 4: Create a time series model with Prophet

Thhe CSV files provided contain hourly search trends on google for MercadoLibre, the daily revenue of MercadoLibre, and the closing stock prices for MercadoLibre.
